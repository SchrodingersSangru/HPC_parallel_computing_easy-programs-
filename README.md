## This c code is written for demonstrating the execution on Parallel computing using openMP. 

## this code solves the simple problem that finding the how many times a digit is present in a number. 

## I used openmp pragma, for parallel processing. 

## for running on your cluster, download this get_num_digit.c file on your node, and then run the following command. 

### gcc -fopenmp get_num_digit.c -o get_num_digit 

## and now your binary file will be ready, then do ./get_num_digit and it'll randomly generate a string for you. 

### now put the digit, and get the answer. 


## you can increase the number of threads, on your cluster.
